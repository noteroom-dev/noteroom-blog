        <p class="article-para-text">Let‚Äôs be real. HSC admission season in Bangladesh feels like a mix of panic, pressure, and your aunt asking ‚ÄúWhich college e porbi?‚Äù for the tenth time. It‚Äôs confusing, weirdly intense, and unless you‚Äôve got a cousin who just went through it, no one seems to explain it properly.</p>
        <p class="article-para-text">So here‚Äôs a clear, honest, and straight-to-the-point guide that helps. Whether you‚Äôre aiming for Rajuk, Viqarunnisa, or Dhaka College, or just want to get into a solid college and start fresh, this is for you.</p>
  
        <h2 id="step1">Step 1: Know What You‚Äôre Applying For</h2>
        <p class="article-para-text">Before anything else, figure out what you need to get in. Most colleges (especially top ones) want:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>GPA 5.00 if you‚Äôre applying to science</li>
          <li>A decent GPA (4.5+ usually safe) for commerce or humanities</li>
          <li>Some ask for subject-specific grades especially in math or science</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="article-para-text">You‚Äôll need:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>SSC transcript and certificate</li>
          <li>Birth certificate</li>
          <li>Recent passport-sized photos</li>
          <li>Mobile number used during SSC registration</li>
          <li>Guardian‚Äôs NID (sometimes asked during verification)</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="article-para-text"><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Scan everything. Keep it in your phone and Google Drive. Losing the original the night before the deadline = pain.</p>
  
        <h2 id="step2">Step 2: Decide Which Colleges to Aim For</h2>
        <p class="article-para-text">There are two types of colleges when it comes to admission:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Merit-based colleges via the government portal ‚Äî like Rajuk, Viqarunnisa, Dhaka College, Holy Cross, Ideal, etc.</li>
          <li>Institutions like Notre Dame & Holy Cross ‚Äî they run separate admission processes with their own forms & tests.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="article-para-text">So don‚Äôt put Notre Dame in your government preference list ‚Äî it won‚Äôt work. If you‚Äôre applying to these colleges, check their websites or Facebook pages directly.</p>
        <p class="article-para-text">For the government portal, you‚Äôll list up to 10 choices ‚Äî rank them smartly:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>2‚Äì3 dream colleges</li>
          <li>4‚Äì5 mid-tier options</li>
          <li>2‚Äì3 backups (realistic safety net)</li>
        </ul>
  
        <h2 id="step3">Step 3: Make a Study Plan</h2>
        <p class="article-para-text">Look, you don‚Äôt need a bullet journal or 4-color highlighters. Just write down:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>What subjects you're struggling with</li>
          <li>Topics you want to revise before college starts</li>
          <li>Entrance prep (if you're applying to Notre Dame, Holy Cross, etc.)</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="article-para-text">If you‚Äôre still in ‚Äúpost-SSC chill mode,‚Äù that‚Äôs fine. But HSC isn‚Äôt slow-paced. Having a headstart makes life easier later.</p>
  
        <h2 id="step4">Step 4: Online Form? Here‚Äôs What Actually Matters</h2>
        <p class="article-para-text">If you‚Äôre going through <code>xiclassadmission.gov.bd</code>, here‚Äôs how it works:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Choose up to 10 colleges</li>
          <li>Rank them carefully</li>
          <li>Submit with a small fee via bKash/Nagad</li>
          <li>Wait for your result (they‚Äôll notify you via SMS)</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="article-para-text">Things to keep in mind:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Choose shift wisely (morning/evening) ‚Äî some colleges have separate merit lists</li>
          <li>Save your transaction ID</li>
          <li>Don‚Äôt panic if you don‚Äôt get your top choice ‚Äî there are multiple phases for migration and re-application</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="article-para-text">üéØ <strong>Again:</strong> Notre Dame, Holy Cross, etc. do not use this process. You need to collect and submit their form separately.</p>
  
        <h2 id="step5">Step 5: Prep for Mini Admission Tests (If Needed)</h2>
        <p class="article-para-text">Colleges like Notre Dame, Holy Cross, and a few others might ask for small written tests, usually based on SSC-level English and general knowledge.</p>
        <p class="article-para-text">So brush up on:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Basic English grammar and comprehension</li>
          <li>Current events and GK</li>
          <li>Short essay or paragraph writing</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="article-para-text">If you‚Äôve taken board exams, you‚Äôre more than ready. You just need to dust off the brain cells and review a little.</p>
  
        <h2 id="step6">Step 6: Plan for Fees (Yeah, It Adds Up Fast)</h2>
        <p class="article-para-text">HSC admission isn‚Äôt super expensive, but the little things add up:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Online form fee (around ‡ß≥150‚Äì200)</li>
          <li>College admission fees (can be ‡ß≥2,000‚Äì‡ß≥12,000 depending on institution)</li>
          <li>Uniforms, books, ID photos, coaching fees if you plan to join any</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="article-para-text">Start tracking early so nothing catches you off guard.</p>
  
        <h2 id="step7">Step 7: Ask for Help</h2>
        <p class="article-para-text">If this whole process is making you overthink everything, talk to someone. Ask a friend, older cousin, or a teacher. Even the local photocopy guy near the college usually knows what‚Äôs up.</p>
        <p class="article-para-text">This isn‚Äôt about being the smartest in the room ‚Äî it‚Äôs about getting through the process without messing up something small.</p>
  
        <h2 id="bonus">Bonus: This Is Your Fresh Start (Rebrand Time)</h2>
        <p class="article-para-text">HSC life gives you a rare chance to change how you show up. If you want to switch from the ‚ÄúI barely passed SSC‚Äù kid to the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm actually trying now‚Äù version of yourself ‚Äî this is it.</p>
        <p class="article-para-text">New college, new habits, maybe even a new group of friends.</p>
        <p class="article-para-text">So start fresh. Get organized. Write that first list. You don‚Äôt need to have everything figured out, but knowing where you‚Äôre headed makes a big difference.</p>
        <p class="article-para-text">If this helped, keep an eye out as we‚Äôll be dropping more guides to help with HSC life, university prep, and figuring out what comes next.</p>
        <p class="article-para-text">And yeah, if your relatives ask again ‚Äúkothay apply korcho?‚Äù ‚Äî now you‚Äôve got answers.</p>
